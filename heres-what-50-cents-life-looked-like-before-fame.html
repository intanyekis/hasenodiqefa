Released under a joint deal between <strong><a href=#>Eminem</a></strong>'s Shady Records and Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment, GRoDT is a debut major-label album that any rapper could ever dream of. The hype and buzz that surrounded the rapper at the time propelled the album to become one of the highest-selling records of all time by a debutant, and Fif wasn't going to stop there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How 50 Cent Remade Himself As A TV Producer</a></span></p><p>Fast forward to 2022, 50 Cent has cemented his rap royalty status. Its follow-up album, The Massacre, was another commercial success while his third, Curtis, birthed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a classic power showdown between him and Kanye West</a>. He had also ventured into TV and films and made a name for himself in the acting industry. But, how did his life look like before all the glitz and glam? To sum it up, here's a look into 50 Cent's life before fame.</p><h2 id=50-cent-39-s-childhood><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>50 Cent's Childhood</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>50 Cent, whose original name is Curtis James Jackson III, was born in the summer of 1975 in the borough of Queens, New York City. Growing up during the crack epidemic in the South Jamaica neighborhood, young Curtis never had it easy. His mother, Sabrina, sold illegal substances in the neighborhood until she passed away in a tragic fire.</p><p>Young Curtis then moved to live with his grandmother, but it didn't stop him from the life of crime. At the age of 12, he began selling cracks to support her and had been arrested in the summer of 1994.</p><h2 id=why-curtis-jackson-chose-50-cent-for-his-name><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Why Curtis Jackson Chose 50 Cent For His Name</span></h2><p>In the meantime, young Curtis also participated in boxing and adopted "50 Cent" as his moniker. Inspired by Kelvin Martin, a Bronx-based criminal who passed away in 1987, the name stage represents "a metaphor of change" for the rapper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It says everything I want it to say," he told Stuff Magazine in 2005. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I’m the same kind of person 50 Cent was. </a>I provide for myself by any means."</p><h2 id=how-50-cent-learned-to-rap><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How 50 Cent Learned To Rap</span></h2><p>Two years after being released from jail, 50 took his rap career seriously after a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC who was at the beginning of creating a record label. Fif learned the art of writing bars and singing chorus from the very best, hence he has such a unique voice in hip-hop. Unfortunately, the two parted ways in 1999 following a feud that ultimately resulted in Master Jay's death.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>50 Cent Lost 50 lbs. For A Movie No One Saw, Here's What Happened</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I started writing lyrics full time in 1997. I met Jam Master Jay from Run D.M.C. and he had his label, which would take people on and develop them until they were ready to go to a major," Fif wrote, adding, "Jay taught me how to count bars – and when the chorus should start and stop. And I kept [practicing]. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sometimes hard work beats talent. </a>I wrote all the time, and so I got better and better."</p><h2 id=when-50-cent-signed-to-nas-39-columbia-records><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>When 50 Cent Signed To Nas' Columbia Records</span></h2><p>Now free agent, 50 Cent quickly signed to Columbia Records thanks to his connection with Trackmasters. The label is known to house some of the biggest names in music, including <strong><a href=#>Beyoncé </a></strong>of Destiny's Child, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Johnny Cash, Billie Joel, and more. In a span of just two weeks, 50 Cent went to record and produce over 36 songs - some of them were enlisted on his intended debut album under the label, Power of the Dollar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=50-cent-39-s-first-hit-song><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>50 Cent's First Hit Song</span></h2><p>50 Cent kicked off his rap career with an explosive debut single, "How to Rob." While it was never released commercially, the track propelled his name as "the underground king who'd never been crowned." "How to Rob" is a troll rap before it was cool, which comically entails what 50 would do if he was to rob some of the biggest names in hip-hop like <strong><a href=#>Jay-Z</a></strong>, Big Pun, DMX, Will & Jada Pinkett Smith, Timbaland, Busta Rhymes, and more.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does 50 Cent Make His Money These Days?</a></span></p><h2 id=when-50-cent-was-shot-9-times><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>When 50 Cent Was Shot 9 Times</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the success of "How to Rob," 50 Cent followed it up with Destiny's Child-backed second single, "Thug Love." However, just two days before he was set to film its music video, 50 Cent's old life came back to haunt him, as he was shot nine times and almost died from the encounter. Not wanting to associate themselves with 50's dangerous upbringing, Columbia Records decided to drop him out of the label.</p><p>"After I got shot nine times at close range and didn't die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I'm gone</a>," he recalled in an interview with Billboard.</p><h2 id=50-cent-released-back-to-back-mixtapes-before-signing-to-eminem-39-s-shady-records><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>50 Cent Released Back-To-Back Mixtapes Before Signing To Eminem's Shady Records</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After his recovery, 50 Cent flew to Canada because he was blackballed by the industry in the US. He linked up with producer Sha Money XL, who later served as the president of 50's G-Unit Records label, to record over thirty songs for mixtapes: 50 Cent Is The Future and Guess Who's Back (2002). He touched the hottest beats in hip-hop within these records. The latter project ended up landing in Eminem's hands.</p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-50-cent><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What's Next For 50 Cent?</span></h2><p>So, what's next for 50 Cent? Surely, his hard days are long gone, and his rap career has peaked within his first three albums. Now, he seems to be focused more on his other side of artistry: TV and films. His Power series was a hit, and he's currently gearing up to join the ensemble cast of The Expendables 4, which will be released in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>50 Cent Reignites Feud With Madonna By Trolling Her Latest Selfie</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZG5oXZiyr8DSZqOinpViubC7yp6bZqSZoLJursSfpqudXZuurrGO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ryan-cabrera-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ryan Cabrera Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
