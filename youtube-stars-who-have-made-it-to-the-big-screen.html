The popularity of social media has kick-started new ways to get a face and name out there, highlighting new kinds of celebrity status, however, for some that dream of being on the big screen still remains. While YouTube provides an accessible way to be featured online, it’s not always easy to break away from one form of media into another. That said, these YouTube stars not only found their following online, but used it to break into the business and find their way into film and TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=grace-helbig-delivered-on-the-daily><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Grace Helbig Delivered On The Daily</span></h2><p>In the early days of YouTube, the world watched on as individuals brought comedy and chaos to everyday life through their vlogs. To combat boredom, Grace Helbig set up her own channel to document her everyday life as she housesat. Her name and content picked up until she set out with DailyGrace, amassing over 2.4 million subscribers by the end of 2013. It was no surprise then that success in other opportunities started kicking up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including roles in Trolls, Smosh: The Movie, and The Wedding Year</a>.

Many in the first few years used the platform to express their creativity, including the writing, acting, and producing of comedy skits. Jimmy Tatro joined the crowd in 2011, working alongside his friend Christian Pierce to produce skits that found an audience of over 3.4 million. Tatro took a step away from YouTube in 2013 when he earned a small role in Grown Ups 2 starring Adam Sandler. Since that first appearance, he’s made his way into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of big screen appearances</a> such as 22 Jump Street, American Vandal, Modern Family, and Smallfoot.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Bizarre '21 Jump Street' And 'Men In Black' Crossover That Almost Happened</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jon-lajoie-joined-the-league><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jon Lajoie Joined The League</span></h2><p>Standing out from the Canadian crowd, Jon Lajoie made his way in the online world from early days.

Within one year she landed her role in Ant-Man and hasn't stopped since.

While the group built up a large following while employed by Buzzfeed, their real break came after separating to launch their own company in 2018. Their hit personalities have resulted in several spin-off series, a book, and a show with Food Network, however, it’s Eugene Lee Yang who has jumped into the world of film and TV alone.
