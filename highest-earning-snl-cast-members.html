From John Belushi to Tina Fey to Jason Sudeikis, SNL has proved to be a veritable training ground for some of the best comedians in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>SNL is a late-night live television show that features sketch comedies, monologues and musical performances. It has won 36 Emmy Awards, three Writers Guild Awards and a Peabody Award. It has also been consistently named as one of the greatest television shows of all time.</p><p>The show made its debut in 1975 with cast members like Belushi, Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd. Cast members at that time were paid $750 for each episode. The show’s success allowed their rates to be bumped up to $2,000 in the second season before it doubled to $4,000 by season four. In the late 90s, salaries were scaled depending on the cast member’s length of service. New members earned $5,500 per episode.Those in their second years got $6,000 per episode, while long-time members could get as much as $12,500 per episode. Will Ferrell was earning $17,500 per episode in his sixth year in 2001. The likes of Billy Crystal and Martin Short were earning up to $25,000 per episode back in the mid-80s, but the two were already established stars back then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In other words, cast members earn almost equal amounts as the salaries are within a tight range. They start earning huge amounts of money, however, once they start hitting it big on their own through their own television series, movies or even television hosting gigs. Jimmy Fallon now has his late night talk show and is worth $16 million. Recent cast members like Andy Samberg and Kristen Wiig are worth $6 million to $8 million. Jason Sudeikis has assets worth $4 million. Amy Poehler has her own sit-com and is believed to be worth around $18 million.</p><p>Still, they pale in comparison to other former cast members. Here is a list of the top 10 highest earning SNL cast members.</p><h2 id=10-tina-fey---45-million><b>10.
