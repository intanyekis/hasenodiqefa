I guess talking to my mum about something, I don't know what, and then my dad came in,” Radcliffe told Thrillist. “I remember hearing the phone ring, and I remember it being picked up, and then three minutes later my dad just came up the stairs and he was like, 'They're going to tell you officially tomorrow, but we've just got the call sounding us out, it's happening,' and I freaked out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-believes-it-was-his-enthusiasm-that-won-him-the-role><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Daniel Radcliffe Believes It Was His Enthusiasm That Won Him The Role</span></h2><p>Radcliffe told The Huffington Post, “The thing that I will always say about myself is I was not the most gifted child actor.” The actor added, “When I look at other young actors, like when I look at the kids on ‘Stranger Things’ or shows like that, I’m just like, ‘Holy! My god! How are you doing that?’ It’s amazing. The thing I think I really was good at, and the thing I had, which was a huge advantage for me, was I just loved it.”</p><h2 id=the-first-day-of-shooting-the-sorcerer-s-stone-was-the-most-nerve-wracking-thing-for-him><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>The First Day Of Shooting ‘The Sorcerer’s Stone’ Was ‘The Most Nerve-Wracking Thing’ For Him</span></h2><p>“The most nerve-wracking thing was the first day, because before that it had just been me, Rupert [Grint], Emma [Watson], and Chris, rehearsing in Chris's office,” Radcliffe told BBC.</p><p>He continued: “I got the call sheet for the first day, I looked under the cast and it said "Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint". So I thought, Fine, I'm used to that. Then I turned over the page and it said: "Extras, 150."
