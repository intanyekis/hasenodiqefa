actor and film producer Brad Pitt</a> also owns a variety of looks from independent manufacturers that you've probably never heard of. It's fair to assume that Brad Pitt is now very busy. With six children, three dogs, and a $385 million total net worth despite making <a href=#>some of the worst films in Hollywood</a>, his divorce from Angelina Jolie may be one of the most contentious in the history of the film industry.</p><p>Pitt's watch collection is one item that, ideally, won't be divided up throughout the court proceedings. The actor from Oklahoma has an extensive collection of high-end watches from brands like Rolex, Patek Philippe, Cartier, A. Lange & Sohne, and others.Pitt, though, varies his choices, much like the movies he chooses to see. Terra Cielo Mare and Red Monkey Designs are two of his favorite niche watch companies. Even wearing independent names in his films is too far for him. The priciest watch items in his collection are listed below:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="15 Signs Angelina Jolie Is Living Her Best Life Since Split From Brad Pitt" href=#>15 Signs Angelina Jolie Is Living Her Best Life Since Split From Brad Pitt</a></span></p><h2 id=patek-phillippe-nautilus-5711>Patek Phillippe Nautilus 5711</h2><p>The actor's high-end sports watch&nbsp; which costs $300,000 boasts a stainless-steel case and strap with a black dial. Although elegant and attractive, it can be worn up or down for any situation. It is a remarkably adaptable watch that is water-resistant to 120 meters. It is also challenging to find. Although the 400mm size is trendy, the tiny dimensions improve the watch's sporting look. In happier times, his ex-wife Angelina Jolie gave him the $300,000 Nautilus as a gift when they were engaged.</p><h2 id=cartier-tank-a-guichet>Cartier Tank a Guichet</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The absence of a dial on the Cartier Tank A Guichet of <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston's ex husband</a> makes it stand out, but this isn't your typical Tank or Santos. Only the jumping hour and wandering minute are indicated in this model. The 18ct pink gold brushed case is fastened to the pack by eight screws and is faceted with a sapphire-set crown. It has a manual winding nickel lever movement with 19 jewels. Only 100 of the limited editions are available. It is a reissue of the original Tank A Guichet from 1928 costs $130,000 and was released to commemorate Cartier's 150th anniversary. Pitt's excellent taste in timepieces is also evident in the gold Cartier Tank a Guichet. The Tank a Guichet is a highly distinctive clock that runs on a jump-hour mechanism that hides the hour and minute numbers behind two tiny windows on a face entirely made of gold. Although Cartier first created this item in 1928, Pitt's is a limited edition of only 100 pieces.</p><h2 id=terra-cielo-mare-orienteering-pvd-watch>Terra Cielo Mare Orienteering PVD Watch</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad Pitt sports a Terra Cielo Mare Orienteering PVD watch in the film World War Z. This watch was made by the small, independent watchmaker Terra Cielo Mare, which is Italian for Earth, Sky, and Sea. When Terra Cielo Mare was first established in 1999, the Italian military was a significant source of design inspiration for its clocks. The Terra Cielo Mare Orienteering Watches which cost $18,000 is perfect for people with a spirit of exploration and adventure, are made by an Italian watchmaker headquartered just outside of Milan who aspires to create unique and striking timepieces.</p><h2 id=tag-heuer-carrera>TAG Heuer Carrera</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike the characters he plays in movies, Brad enjoys diversifying his watch collection.&nbsp;The <a href=#>actor who has moved on</a> from Jolie&nbsp;represents TAG Heuer outside of the U.S. and Canada. His watch is a TAG Heuer Carrera which costs $15,000 that has a matching 43 mm stainless steel case and band that Silver hands, three subdials, a day/date display at 3 o'clock, and a tachymeter bezel are all on the black analog dial. Swiss automatic movement powers it.</p><h2 id=rolex-explorer>Rolex Explorer</h2><p>Early in his career in the 2000s, when Pitt appeared in films like Fight Club and Ocean's Eleven, he was frequently spotted using a rather basic Rolex Explorer. It is said that the Rolex Explorer is the best sports model and that this watch costs $10,000. It clearly displays the time while doing so. It boasts a slim case that is still the only Rolex sports model to not have a super casing, a formidable movement that can withstand punishment, and nothing else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=breitling-super-chronomat-b01-44mm>Breitling Super Chronomat B01 44mm</h2><p>And only last week, Brad Cooper and one of the <a href=#>most underrated actor in Hollywood</a>, Brad Pitt were spotted inconspicuously at the U.S. Men's Singles Open Competition. Another Breitling was on his wrist; , the attractive Breitling Super Chronomat B01 44mm. The list price of this item is $9,000.Breitling's turbocharged watch for all of your endeavors. The original Breitling Chronomat from the 1980s, designed for the top members of aerobatic squadrons, served as the model for the Super Chronomat. The Super Chronomat, the most daring of all Chronomat watches, has multiple ceramic components, including those on the bezel, the chronograph pushers, and the crown, in addition to a rubber strap with a Rouleaux-inspired design.</p><h2 id=breitling-premier-b01-chronograph-42-norton>Breitling Premier B01 Chronograph 42 Norton</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pitt was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unveiled as a Breitling ambassador</a> in 2019. Since that time, Pitt has been spotted without a Breitling on his wrist which only costs $8,900. The Breitling Premier B01 Chronograph 42 Norton is one of the Breitling watches Pitt has been spotted wearing most frequently. Pitt has grown to love the Breitling Premier B01 Chronograph 42 Norton, which honors the watch company's collaboration with Norton, a British motorcycle manufacturer. The transparent case back of the $8900 watch has an engraving of the Norton motorcycle and insignia.</p><h2 id=breitling-avenger-chronograph-watch>Breitling Avenger Chronograph Watch</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor who had <a href=#>one of the most expensive settlements</a> with Angelina Jolie has also been spotted donning a Breitling Avenger which costs $2,800, a chronograph watch that truly complements the rest of his watch collection and has a distinct military design. Breitling Avenger has a unidirectional rotating bezel and a 45 mm black titanium casing. Its khaki analog dial has luminous gunmetal hands, three subdials, white Arabic numerals, and a date window at 3 o'clock and is driven by an automatic self-winding movement. The strap is made of khaki leather, has a 48-hour power reserve, and is water-resistant up to 300 meters or 1000 feet.</p><h2 id=breitling-emergency>Breitling Emergency</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt claimed that the Breitling Emergency</a> was his first nice watch which costs around $3,200 and that he adored it so much that he gave one to each member of his family and close friends who travel frequently. To provide a backup transmitter for downed pilots or wandering explorers, Breitling created the Breitling Emergency. The watch includes a last-ditch SOS mechanism to safeguard the wearer's safety while in distress and is equipped with the capacity to emit an emergency signal at 121.5MHz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="A Peek Inside Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolieâs French Winery, Chateau Miraval" href=#>A Peek Inside Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolieâs French Winery, Chateau Miraval</a></span></p><p>Sources : <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaz time</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hindustan Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SCMP</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8yrZKylmam1tHnWmqucoJWoerW0xKycZpmimnq1tMRmpKirpGKyubzEp6qirpVixKLAwqGcrGWZo3qjvsCdZKmhpKnAbq%2FOpaOem6SevK97</p></div><div id=links><a href=./youtube-stars-who-have-made-it-to-the-big-screen.html>&#171;&nbsp;YouTube Stars Who Have Made It To The Big Screen</a>
