Unfortunately, so many actors that have appeared in Superman movies went on to have very dark chapters in their life that many people believe that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the franchise is cursed</a>. After all, George Reeves suspiciously passed early, Margot Kidder had a breakdown, and Christopher Reeves became paralyzed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, there are many other movies and franchises that many people now <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">think are cursed</a>. For example, many of the people who worked on Poltergeist, The Omen, and The Excorcist suffered extremely unfortunate fates. Of course, many other people write all of those circumstances off to mere coincidence but it does seem odd.</p><p>Up until recently, all of the most memorable supposed Hollywood curses were linked to movies. However, that has certainly changed as of late since several of the actors that starred in Glee have publicly been involved in really bad, and even deadly, situations.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At The Curse And Real-Life Killer Cast In 'The Exorcist'</a></span></p><h2 id=a-surprise-hit>A Surprise Hit</h2><p>Before Glee debuted on Fox in 2009, there weren’t any musical shows that were lighting the television world on fire. For that reason, it seems likely that many of the people involved with the show thought it wasn’t going to last very long but it became a surprise hit that lasted 6 seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sporting an extremely long cast list, Glee introduced the masses to many talented young actors and reminded them of some older stars too. In the case of people like Darren Criss, Jane Lynch, Jonathan Groff, Jayma Mays, and Matthew Morrison, there is no doubt that starring in Glee was beneficial to their careers. After all, each of those actors have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gone on to do big things</a> in the years since the show ended. Sadly, the same thing can’t be said for several former Glee stars.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How ‘Glee’ Star Jane Lynch Amassed Her $16 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=abused-and-invaded>Abused And Invaded</h2><p>Of all the people that are said to have been affected by the supposed Glee curse, Melissa Benoist is the only one that remains alive to this day. More than that, Benoist deserves a lot of praise as she has shown a great deal of inner strength even as she has suffered through some horrible situations that were no fault of her own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In late-2019, Melissa Benoist logged onto Instagram, sat in front of her camera, and spoke to the public about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">severe abuse she suffered</a> during a relationship. In the nearly 15-minute long video stream, she detailed how she was manipulated, controlled, and physically hurt by her significant other.</p><p>While Melissa Benoist suffered many incidents of violence during the relationship, the most appalling was the time she had a phone thrown at her face, which she spoke about in the video stream. "The impact tore my iris, nearly ruptured my eyeball, lacerated my skin, and broke my nose. My left eye swelled shut, I had a fat lip, blood was coursing down my face and I can remember immediately screaming at the top of my lungs."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of being involved in a horrible relationship, Melissa Benoist also had her privacy invaded when she was hacked and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">images of her intimate moments were stolen</a> from her. If Benoist didn’t realize that her images were taken at first, she certainly became aware of it when they spread online and were viewed by millions of people. Sadly, Glee actor Becca Tobin also was a victim of the same series of hacks and leaks.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mystery Of James Dean's Cursed Car Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=untimely-demises>Untimely Demises</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, three different Glee stars have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">passed away at young ages</a>. In the case of Mark Salling, his career came to an immediate end and his reputation was destroyed when he faced charges of possessing intimate photos of children. Opting to plead guilty and set to be sentenced in the coming months, Salling took his own life instead of awaiting his fate in court.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, the world is filled with people who face substance abuse issues at one point in their life or another. After struggling with illegal substances for the first time during his teens, Cory Monteith managed to get things under control and remained sober for many years. Of course, addiction is a lifelong issue for most, and Monteith gave in to his cravings which led to him tragically passing away with many substances in his system.</p><p>In July of 2020, Naya Rivera rented a pontoon so she could take her 4-year-old son on the lake for a day. Sadly, it became clear that the event which should have been a joyous family memory went horribly awry when her son was found asleep on the boat without anyone else in sight. After a search and rescue effort that lasted several days, Rivera was found and it was confirmed that she’d lost her life. Later it came out that Rivera’s son had described being pushed back into the boat by his mother, so at least Naya was a hero in her final moments.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebs Who’ve Suffered From ‘The Kardashian Curse’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnZqmo2LBqbXNpGStoJVitK2xxGaamqukYra0edKtoKWkXZjCs7%2FEnWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./lily-newmark.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Netflix's Cursed star, Lily Newmark dating?
