The LA-girl's voice captivated users on social media.</p><p>Debbii Dawson is a singer, songwriter, and producer who specializes in Indie Pop and R&B. Dawson was born in Minnesota and moved to San Francisco before settling in Los Angeles. She specializes in putting unique acoustic takes on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">popular songs</a>, which is precisely what she did for her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'AGT' audition</a>. The night's last singer delivered a stripped-down version of ABBA's 'Dancing Queen'. Mandel described her as having "star quality," and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter users couldn't agree more</a>.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>‚ÄòAmerica‚Äôs Got Talent‚Äô on NBC: Who is Ava Swiss?

Simon retorts that Debii appears confident as she goes in, despite her nervousness. Debii, who resides in Los Angeles, considers music to be more than just a passion; it is her legacy. Her grandpa in India trained himself to play the organ by sketching a keyboard on the concrete with charcoal. That's how he taught himself, and afterward, her father, who eventually taught her. They were accomplished musicians. Her father immigrated to the United States and attended college there.</p><p>She shares the story of her parents' meeting at college when her mother was playing the piano in the practice room and her father happened to walk by. They ultimately fell in love. Simon couldn't help but joke at the fact that her parents were not present during the auditions. Despite his quip that it is not a good sign, Debii blasts the roof off the audition room when she sings ABBA's 'Dancing Queen' while playing her guitar. All of the judges, as well as the crowd, gave her a standing ovation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/9cbb23ff-9711-49ee-8f2c-6862302d08eb.png><p>Heidi proceeded with Simon's joke, lamenting the fact that her parents were not present. Simon believes they squandered a golden opportunity. Howie said she sounded "really sweet and soothing," and that she has star potential. Sofia admits that there's something about Debii that makes her want to listen to her voice all day. It's fantastic, and she adores it. Heidi felt it was lovely, but she wished she looked up more often because she wanted to see her - her gorgeous self and her great voice. Simon adds that he enjoyed how Debii took one of the most well-known pop tunes of all time and literally made it her own. He acknowledges that he will remember the audition and is overjoyed that she auditioned for the show. With all four yeses from the judges, they forced her to call her parents, revealing the fact that she was the one who begged her not to be there.</p><p>Meanwhile, fans were all praises for Debii and her unique voice, with many demanding to see more of her in future. A fan tweeted: "Debbii Dawson has such an unique voice. I definitely see her going far #AGT." Another fan makes an early prediction for Debii: "Alright very early #AGT prediction but this girl with the guitar is going to win it all, I think her name is Debbie." One fan called Debii's version of "Dancing Queen" their new favorite: "Possibly my new favorite cover of Dancing Queen.
