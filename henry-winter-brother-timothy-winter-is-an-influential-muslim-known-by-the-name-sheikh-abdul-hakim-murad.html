And he took up Islam as he didn’t find that with Christianity.</p><p dir=ltr>Fans have requested Henry to bring his brother on his social media handle, but the older sibling has shown no interest in doing so.</p><p dir=ltr>But the latest engagement of Henry and a football fan has shown that the writer loves to listen to the prayers in Islam as much as his brother.</p><h2 id=henry-winter-brother-timothy-winter><span class=ez-toc-section id=henry-winter-has-one-older-brother-timothy-winter></span> Henry Winter Has One Older Brother Timothy Winter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Henry Winter has an older brother three years his senior, Timothy Winter. His brother is known by his Muslim name Sheikh Abdul-Hakim Murad.</p><p>Timothy is one of the most influential Muslim thinkers in the UK.&nbsp;He is three years older than his brother Henry, and as kids, the two seemingly had different interests. Timothy had dived deep into religion. On the other hand, like any normal British lad, Henry loved playing football with his mates.</p><p>And in the coming years, the paths of the two brothers kept diverging along the road. But if there was something in common between the two, then it was having their names often printed on papers.</p><p>Henry went on to work for the prominent British newspaper, The Times, as a sports writer, whereas Timothy became an Islamic scholar who gained fame all over the UK.</p><p>Timothy has had many controversial thoughts in the past, which he has said out loud in public. But he has since backed down from some of the comments, including talking about homosexuality in a bad light.</p><p>A graduate of Cambridge Univerisity, Timothy converted to Islam when he was 19. In one of his interviews, the Islam scholar said his interest in Islamic art and the study of Arabic made him want to convert his religion.</p><p>Though the brothers do not have many public moments together, the recent tweet of Henry Winter has everyone talking about his support towards his brother’s religion as he posted the video of England Team training while the call to prayer played in the background.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=meet-timothy-winter-wife-nabila-winter><span class=ez-toc-section id=henry-winter-older-brother-timothy-winter-is-married-to-wife-nabila-winter></span> Henry Winter Older Brother Timothy Winter Is Married To Wife Nabila Winter <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The older brother of Henry Winter, Timothy Winter, is married to Nabila Winter. His wife is the Welfare Officer at Cambridge Muslim College.</p><p>Like her husband, Nabila has a degree in Arabic. She&nbsp;is pivotal in providing pastoral care to the students in the Diploma and BA programs. Previously, Nabila has done several voluntary and youth works.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Timothy has shared several videos of himself talking about the concept of marriage in Islam but has kept the details of his marriage a secret. Anything that takes away a person’s attention from God is a sin in Islam, and marriage could be one of the distractions for some.&nbsp;</p><p>The scholar also talked about the qualities while choosing a spouse. One should look for someone who expects to be judged based on what they mean rather than what they do.&nbsp;</p><p>His thinking toward the concept of marriage has been given resounding support in the comments section. But in the past, he seemed to have a distaste towards the love between the ‘same gender’.</p><p>Winter even went on to say that he thought people from the LGBTQ community are arsonists. In the eight-minute rant video, he even said that people from the LGBTQ community are ignorant. He has since apologized for the comments.</p><h2 id=henry-winter-family><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-two-winter-brothers-come-from-an-elite-family></span> The Two Winter Brothers Come From An Elite Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Times writer Henry Winter, his brother, and his sister came from an elite family in the UK. They grew up as children of an architect and a designer in Regent’s Park.&nbsp;</p><p>When interviewed by his employers in 2021, the writer opened up about his relationship with his parents. And unlike many parents, Winter’s told their son to follow his passion.&nbsp;</p><p>Henry’s father, John Winter, is a former architect who, by Henry’s description, seemed to have had an enthralling life. From living nearby Russian spies to being a neighbor to Karl Marz, the Winter family had seen it all.</p><p>Because of his parent’s work, Henry got the chance to live in Paris and Munich for a brief time. The writer has said, his French and German still need a lot of work.</p><p>Henry has a famous brother in Timothy but also a sister named Martha, a painter. The writer is married to an actress who has previously starred in the opening credits of the Bond movie.</p><p>The couple shares two children, Electra and Toby, and like Henry, his kids have already been exposed to different cultures. His daughter Electra attended a school in Toulouse, and his son Toby studied at Shaolin Temple in China.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCVo7%2B6edaipa2domKvs7vToZyrZaSeurDAx7JksKGeqbKzecisZJqmXZ67p7jUnqWtoZGheq7B0qWgpmWbo7y4uoybsGasmJp6r63MnmSsoJWeuKl5wJubrqRdna6stcxmpK6qkZl8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./heres-what-these-former-greys-anatomy-actors-have-done-since-leaving-the-show.html>&#171;&nbsp;Here's What These Former 'Grey's Anatomy' Actors Have Done Since Leaving The Show</a>
