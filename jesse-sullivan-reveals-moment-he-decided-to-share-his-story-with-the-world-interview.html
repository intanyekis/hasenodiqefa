I knew, in that moment, I was going to tell the world my story."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Jesse, telling his story was about more than him - it was an opportunity to help those who needed it most.</p><p>"I just really want to comfort those who need it. It's hard enough to be a kid or a teenager, but to have almost the whole world against you? I'm going to change that."</p><p>And just like that, his mission to creating the world he wanted to see began.</p><h2 id=jesse-explains-how-life-has-changed-since-sharing-his-story>Jesse Explains How Life Has Changed, Since Sharing His Story</h2><p>Jesse may be on a path to change the world, but that's not to say it's been an easy walk.</p><p>Quite the contrary, he shares that there have been challenges along the way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Pose’ Fans Over The Moon As Mj Rodriguez Becomes First Trans Lead To Score Emmy Nod</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"The biggest struggle,"</strong> he begins, <strong>"is constantly putting really vulnerable parts of myself out there for millions to see.

That's all I want."</p><p>Mission accomplished - though, something tells us this is the beginning of big things for Jesse.</p><h2 id=he-also-muses-on-being-recognized-more-often>He Also Muses On Being Recognized More Often</h2><p>Given how many people he's helped, it only makes sense that Jesse's public profile has grown - and though he doesn't consider himself famous, he shares that he's aware of being recognized more often, especially when out and about with his teenager, Arlo.</p><p>"I definitely noticed a shift when Arlo and I started getting stopped for pictures with fans."</p><p>Jesse even shares that at one point, <strong>"it almost became overwhelming to be at malls, Targets or theme parks."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, far from being averse to the attention, he smiles that even though it took some getting used to, both he and Arlo are grateful for it.</p><p>"It's pretty amazing, it warms our hearts, and we appreciate every single person who supports us."</p><p>So, he urges with a chuckle, <strong>"if you see us, don't be shy.
