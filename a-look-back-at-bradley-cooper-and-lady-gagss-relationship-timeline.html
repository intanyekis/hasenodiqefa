become some of the biggest names in Hollywood, and for all the right reasons. Not only has Gaga changed the music industry for good, but Bradley has also risen to international stardom through his various roles in film and television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it was revealed that Gaga and Cooper would be taking on the roles as Ally and Jackson in 'A Star Is Born', fans could not wait to see it all play out on-screen. While we would have loved to see a real-life romance, we will definitely settle for the incredible performance the two gave throughout the film.</p><p>It was one of Gaga's first major movie roles, and Bradley's first go at directing, and it is safe to say that the two absolutely crushed it in all the best ways. The two worked together over the course of two years, and have spent a lot of time together, so here is a look back at Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's relationship.</p><h2 id=the-first-encounter><span class=item-num>40 </span><span>The First Encounter</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>39 </span><span></span></h2><p>Before Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper were jet setting across the globe to promote their incredible fil, 'A Star Is Born', they were working out the details during their first-ever encounter, which happened back in 2016! Bradley was the special guest host on 'SNL', while Gaga was the performer, and the rest is history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=los-angeles-premiere><span class=item-num>38 </span><span>Los Angeles Premiere</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>37 </span><span></span></h2><p>When it was first announced that Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper would be remaking the iconic film for its fourth time, fans and followers of both stars were beyond excited. The duo attended just about every film festival known to mankind, and boy did they show up dressed to impress!</p><h2 id=venice-film-festival><span class=item-num>36 </span><span>Venice Film Festival</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>35 </span><span></span></h2><p>While we are used to seeing Lady Gaga in far more interesting ensembles, to say the least, the singer and actress attended the Venice Film Festival back in 2018 in a simple and classic white dress. She and Bradley certainly know how to work the red carpet, almost as much as selling their non-existent relationship to promote the film.</p><h2 id=the-look-we-all-fell-in-love-with><span class=item-num>34 </span><span>The Look We All Fell In Love With</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>33 </span><span></span></h2><p>While we would love for these exceptions beings to be in love in real life, we will have to give in to these adorable shots of Gaga and Bradley. Fans of the film were hopeful that Lady Gaga and Cooper would end up with one another off-screen, however, they have made it clear that they are simply close friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Men Gaga Has Been Linked To (10 Who Don't Stand A Chance)</a></span></p><h2 id=golden-globes-moment><span class=item-num>32 </span><span>Golden Globes Moment</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>31 </span><span></span></h2><p>The 2019 awards season would have honestly been nothing had it not been for Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's presence. The iconic duo took the lead at every award show from the Golden Globes, SAG Awards, and Oscars. Not only did they take away an award at every show, but they managed to do so wearing some of the finest outfits we've seen to date.</p><h2 id=visit-to-the-graham-norton-show><span class=item-num>30 </span><span>Visit To The 'Graham Norton Show'</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>29 </span><span></span></h2><p>'A Star Is Born' was heavily promoted, and rightfully so! Despite the constant travelling, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper were always happy to discuss their roles and the film itself. One of our favourite interviews was on none other than the 'Graham Norton Show' in the United Kingdom. Not only did Bradley look dapper, but Gaga was truly working that red dress.</p><h2 id=a-hollywood-premiere><span class=item-num>28 </span><span>A Hollywood Premiere</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2><span class=item-num>27 </span><span></span></h2><p>When the film finally premiered in the United States, you bet that Gaga and Bradley went all out for its Hollywood premiere. Everybody who is anybody attended the premiere and instantly fell in love with both characters on-screen. The duo absolutely crushed it in the film, and if you haven't seen it, get on that right away.</p><h2 id=backstage-at-the-oscars><span class=item-num>26 </span><span>Backstage At The Oscars</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>25 </span><span></span></h2><p>The ultimate end goal would have been for both Gaga and Bradley to walk away with an Oscar, and while Gaga got hers, fans were upset over Bradley's snub. The actor, who both starred and directed the film, was completely left out of the 'Best Director' character, which didn't go over well with the public. Luckily for Cooper, it didn't seem to bother him too much.</p><h2 id=sag-awards><span class=item-num>24 </span><span>SAG Awards</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>23 </span><span></span></h2><p>It appears white was definitely Lady Gaga's colour of choice through the press tour for 'A Star Is Born'. The 'Born This Way' singer strutted in a stunning white fringed gown with gold accessories, while Bradley Cooper wore a suit that never disappoints. The duo also walked away with a SAG Award each, just as they should have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-trip-to-the-grocery-store><span class=item-num>22 </span><span>A Trip To The Grocery Store</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>21 </span><span></span></h2><p>In order to get into their characters, it was important for Bradley and Lady Gaga to spend loads of time with one another. This is where the rumours regarding the twos relationship off-screen began to surface, however, they paid no mind to those! The two were caught grocery shopping in Los Angeles pre-production, getting ready for a performance of a lifetime.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics Of Lady Gaga That Bradley Cooper Doesn't Want Us To See</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhursCcomaZpGKvs63DpZyyZZOkvLGx0WaYp5xdoa6lxYygmKCro2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF506KknqSZo7Jw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-ecuadorian-businessman-and-politician-alvaro-noboas-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alvaro Noboa Fought For His Inheritance But Couldn't Win Ecuador's Presidency; Here's His Net Worth</a>
