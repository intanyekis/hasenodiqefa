Changed Drastically After The Show</a></span></p><p>The show takes place in a "house" built within a CBS studio stage lot in Los Angeles. The contestants, who are deemed house guests, live in the constantly surveyed space for three months as they compete to become the last person standing in the house. The winner and runner-up get a cash prize and one lucky house guest who fans vote for to receive the "America's Favorite Player" cash prize. Despite how fun the show may look, there's actually a lot that goes into making it. Below, we look closely at what goes on behind the scenes and just how much is expected of the Big Brother cast members during filming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-the-big-brother-filming-schedule-like>What Is The Big Brother Filming Schedule Like?</h2><p>The Big Brother filming schedule is pretty wonky. Some days are action-packed and incredibly grueling, while others are very boring. <a href=#>Rachel Reilly, a former winner of Big Brother and a fan favorite</a> from the franchise, explained the typical schedule to Insider. "When I was on the show, we'd have Head of Household (HOH) competitions on Thursday, the Power of Veto competition on Saturday, Veto meetings Monday, and the HOH's nomination ceremony on Friday," said Rachel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/big-brother-all-stars-about-to-enter-the-house.jpg><p>Rachel also explained that even on the days when there aren't competitions, there's not much else to do but talk game. "We don't get pens to write with, books to read, or cards to play games with — those things might encourage independent activities. The house usually has a chessboard, though, probably designed to remind us that "Big Brother" is like a game of chess," said Rachel to Insider. "The amenities we do get, like an outdoor pool table and shared exercise equipment, encourage us to gather and interact."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Filming of competitions becomes more frequent as the season progresses, with some of the longest filming days happening during the three-part final HOH competition.</p><h2 id=what-is-required-of-big-brother-cast-members>What Is Required Of Big Brother Cast Members?</h2><p>Being a Big Brother cast member <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">might not be as easy as you think</a>. The cast has an array of strict rules they have to follow while living in the house. They're given a rule book from the moment they arrive at their pre-filming sequester space, which is subject to change at any time. During their time in the sequester, housemates must give up their laptops, phones, iPods, and any other device with internet access. The hotel rooms they say in have no television or phone, and they aren't allowed to have alcohol or access the gym, spa, or pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/promo-pic-for-big-brother-20.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We were told to bring a few books, and we received puzzles, games, cards, crossword puzzles, and a portable DVD player with a few seasons of "Big Brother" on it," said season 12 winner Rachel Reilly. "I still don't know if showrunners have us do this to gauge our ability to handle the seclusion from the real world, but I think it worked. I even remember someone quitting during this period because they couldn't handle it."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Big Brother 24's Taylor Hale and Joseph Abdin's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Rachel suggests that the crazy filming schedule is probably what aids in the creation of so many showmances. "Getting to know someone over many conversations while going through an unusual experience can really bond people together. I've made some of my strongest friendships through "Big Brother" — and it's where I met Brendon Villegas, my husband of 10 years," said Rachel to Insider.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/big-brother-stars-rachel-reilly-and-brendon-villegas.jpg><p>The show provides cast members with a list of approved items they're allowed to bring into the house and an outlined list of prohibited items. Their bags are searched before entering, and any prohibited items found are confiscated by production before the bags even make it into the house.</p><p>While in the house, the house guests' conversations are constantly monitored. They have to be wearing their microphone anytime they're awake. If they're caught whispering in an attempt to avoid their microphone picking up their conversations producers will give them a warning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even before making it onto the cast, contestants are tested. During the interview process, potential housemates have to undergo a psychological evaluation and an IQ test. The results help whittle down the pool of potential housemates by half.</p><p>Once selected as official house guests, the contestants must undergo a series of medical tests to ensure they're fit enough to be on the competition show. They're also monitored for COVID-19 exposure now, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">contestants now having to quarantine for two weeks before entering the house since 2020</a>.</p><h2 id=are-the-cameras-on-all-the-time-at-the-big-brother-house>Are The Cameras On All The Time At The Big Brother House?</h2><p>Diehard fans of Big Brother know that the cameras are constantly rolling. According to CBS, 80 cameras in the house capture every move of the house guests. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There are even cameras in the bathrooms</a>, and yes, even where the toilets are - but that's just so producers know if house guests are using the space to hide game conversations. The production team has really gone out of its way to ensure nothing goes on under their noses. It's a huge reason why the show has worked as well as it has for so long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/a-big-brother-bedroom-with-cameras-prominently-featured.jpg><p>The crew really is trying to get the most authentic, accurate version of the show they can. However, it hasn't kept <a href=#>fans from speculating that some competitions have been rigged</a>. However, this has been heavily denied by both cast members and production members.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What The Cast Of Big Brother 24 Has Been Up To Since The Show Wrapped?</a></span></p><p>"The crew is constantly working to watch multiple cameras, listen to our conversations, and come up with ways to tell and follow the stories. Camera operators have to catch the slightest tear and anticipate what each player's next move will be. Other members of the crew spend hours making sets for the competitions," said Rachel Reilly during her interview with Insider.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrCiv9NmqpqhlGKuo7vUrWSboZdir7O706Gcq2WWnrmutc2gZKybmJqxtrjEZpmeoJmjsW7Ax55krJuVo7K0ew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ashley-jade-stern.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Howard Stern's Daughter Ashley Jade Stern?
