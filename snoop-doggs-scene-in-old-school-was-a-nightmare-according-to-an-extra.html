Snoop Dogg's involvement behind the scenes, and what took place. Despite a brief cameo in the film, Snoop's presence was felt in a major way behind the scenes. An extra revealed what it was really like having Snoop on-set and clearly, it made things quite difficult behind the scenes. Let's take a look at what went down, and how Snoop Dogg's tardiness and antics would even alter Will Ferrell's state for the scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Do John C.

Snoop created chaos on the set - though thankfully, this was the last scene that was shot for the film.</p><p>A stand-in for Will Ferrell discussed his experience on-set and as others revealed, it was quite the lengthy process. It all started off with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snoop and his entourage arriving to set hours late</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The stand-in extra reveals with BuzzFeed, "I worked as Will Ferrell's stand-in on Old School. Last day of shooting was the party scene with Snoop Dogg. We knew he was probably gonna be a bit late showing up so they set the call time to be something that wasn't too early, 10 a.m. At 1 p.m. his entourage finally shows up to the sound stages."</p><p>He continues, "We all just kinda laugh it off. Something like 7 or 8 cars in all, including the lime green pimp-mobile from someone in his crew that was an actual pimp."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Snoop Dogg Revealed Things Got Tense With Vince Vaughn Behind The Scenes While Filming Starsky And Hutch</a></span></p><p>That was just the start as things would only get more troubling as the day progressed, and that was especially true for the film's director.</p><h2 id=snoop-dogg-created-massive-delays-and-caused-the-director-to-be-replaced-for-the-party-scene>Snoop Dogg Created Massive Delays And Caused The Director To Be Replaced For The Party Scene</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/snoop-dogg-on-the-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Snoop arrived to set, things did get any easier. The rapper spent hours with his entourage in their trailer, and it seems as though the fun was just getting started behind the scenes.</p><p>"For the next 8 hours or so Snoop and his crew proceed to get insanely high and start smoking out various extras. One of the producers had to put his foot down when Snoop and his crew started inviting them into his trailer. 18-year-old lady extras alone with them in the trailers might present itself as a potential 'issue."</p><p>It would appear as though the director also had a little too much fun and needed to be replaced.</p><p>"The day goes on and the director also gets smoked out by Snoop. He's too high to function any longer so a producer has to step in and finish off the day. We shoot the 'we're going streaking' scene and Will's "sock" keeps coming off.

That held true for Sean Evans during his interview alongside Will Ferrell. The actor revealed that waiting for Snoop was quite the process, and therefore, he decided to do some drinking while he waited. However, given how long he waited for, Will had one too many drinks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He revealed, âIn between takes, it took so long to get Snoop Dogg out of his trailer, as he was smoking (marijuana) and playing video games, that out of boredom I just started drinking."</p><p>Despite the problems behind the scenes, Todd Phillips and his film enjoyed success at the box office, making more than triple the budget at $86 million.</p><p>As far as a sequel goes, Luke Wilson admitted he was open to it, while Will Ferrell feels indifferent about doing a second film. Nonetheless, Todd Phillips did explore the possibility years ago.</p><p>He revealed, "We are writing a sequel which is called "Old School Dos." No actors have been signed yet, and nobody has agreed to be in the film. The plan is that once the script is finished, we will approach the cast and go from there."</p><p>Unfortunately for Old School fans, nothing has been said about a possible sequel despite the rumors and plans from years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqp6efpXqlu8agqmark5q7pnnIp2SopJRiwKS0zqijZq%2BRqHqiec2inqGsnZa%2FpnnAnJqoqpSeu6h506hkmqZdmsW1vsBo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-rob-schneiders-wife-patricia-azarcoya-really-like.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Is Rob Schneider's Wife Patricia Azarcoya Really Like?</a>
