I said, ‘Eternal youth’ — and I got it,” he says, adding: “I’m not embarrassed by it.”</p><p>The Frasers are just two of the many young men increasingly opting for hair-transplant surgery — once taboo and stigmatized thanks to decades of bad plugs and unsightly scars.</p><p>The doctors asked what I want out of this.

More than 80 percent of the increase comes from men.</p><p>“There’s less stigma as famous people are coming out of the closet,” says <a href=#>Dr. Robert Bernstein</a>, a hair transplant surgeon in Midtown. “Soccer players, football players — they’re admitting they’ve had the surgery. Patients bring in pictures of [George] Clooney, Brad Pitt. The stigma of the old plugs is fading.”</p><p>While celebs aren’t writing signed confessions, there’s plenty of speculation about which high-profile men may have gotten procedures — such as LeBron James, Kevin Costner, John Travolta and Jeremy Piven.</p><p>Then there are those who see no shame in their game — including Bosley spokesman Joey Fatone of ’N Sync, one-time boy-bander AJ McLean, and soccer stud Wayne Rooney, 29, who in 2011 tweeted: “Just to confirm to all my followers I have had a hair transplant.

But newer, automated FUE (follicular unit extraction) hair transplants, done with the minimally invasive <a href=#>NeoGraft</a> device, allow surgeons to remove and insert individual hair follicles, yielding a more natural look. If done correctly, transplanted follicles should continue to grow hair indefinitely.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/hair_travolta_before_after1a.jpg><p>For 24-year-old Joel Phil, an Upper East Side television writer for the show “<a href=#>Younger</a>,” his April hair transplant was a long time coming.</p><p>“A teenager shouldn’t have to worry about his hair falling out at 17,” says Phil, who nearly always wore hats to cover up his rapidly receding hairline. “But we live in a superficial society — it kind of hits your confidence.”</p><p>In high school, Phil was already saving up for the $10,000 surgery with Bernstein.</p><p>Five months post-surgery, the writer has a whole new air of confidence.</p><p>“I want to be in front of the camera,” he says. “Now I can worry about one less thing.”</p><p>His small circle of friends who knew about his decision were supportive: “They said, ‘Do whatever makes you feel good about yourself.’”</p><p>Cost for the procedure ranges between $5,000 and $20,000 — depending on the amount of hair to be harvested and transplanted.</p><p>“If someone really wants it, he’ll find a way. They pay outright, they finance it, borrow from relatives,” says Durante of the ways patients come up with the cash.</p><p>Nick Thomas, whose doctor opted to do the old strip technique, shelled out $9,000.</p><p>“I have no shame — it’s made a big difference in my dating confidence.

Some doctors use what’s called a NeoGraft machine, a hand-held surgical device that extracts follicles. There is no cutting or scarring of the scalp, and the results tend to look more natural than traditional transplants. Sedatives and local anesthesia are administered, and recovery time ranges from seven to 10 days. Expect mild tenderness in the days following the procedure.</p><p><strong>The cost:</strong> $5,000 to $20,000, depending on amount of hair replaced</p><p><strong>The hair:</strong> Doctors extract hair from the back rim of the head because those follicles aren’t affected by hormones linked to baldness. “That’s the prime real estate,” says Dr. Keith Durante. Once the follicles are transplanted to the front of the head, they should continue to grow.</p><p><strong>The results:</strong> Results take about a year to fully show. Most patients have two to four transplants over a lifetime — either to double the density in the affected areas or to address additional hair loss down the line. Topical treatments such as Propecia and Rogaine can also be used to maximize volume and growth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnZ7j3FmamhfqbyuecGrmJ2xXZ67tLzIq5ydZZ2ueqmtyKtkraqRo8CxuMCnq2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./beyonce-denim-crop-top-jeans-jay-z-photos.html>&#171;&nbsp;Beyonce Rocks Denim Crop Top &amp;amp; Jeans In Paris With JAY-Z Hollywood Life</a>
