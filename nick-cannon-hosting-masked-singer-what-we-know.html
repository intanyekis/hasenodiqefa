Now in its third season, the reality competition series — which features celebrities&nbsp;performing&nbsp;with masks and elaborate costumes — has garnered a mass following thanks to its vivacious panelists, plethora of surprises, and eclectic costumes ranging from peacocks to bananas and aliens. The panelists are Ken Jeong, Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy, and Nicole Scherzinger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nick Cannon has been hosting the series after his unceremonious exit from ‘America’s Got Talent.’ (The host said he was unhappy with the fact that NBC executives considered firing him after he made a racial joke during a recent Showtime comedy special.)</p><p>Here are 16 things we have learned about ‘The Masked Singer’ thus far, including the fact that it is based on a pre-existing reality TV show.</p><h2 id=contestants-identities-remain-secret-throughout-taping-with-even-nick-cannon-in-the-dark><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Contestants' Identities&nbsp;Remain Secret Throughout Taping, With Even Nick Cannon In The Dark</span></h2><p>If you were ever under the impression Cannon had prior knowledge of who each famous contestant was before taking his/her mask of, think again. The host told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Living,</a>&nbsp;"I personally stay out of when they pick whoever the celebs are in the costumes because I want to be able to play along with everyone else."</p><h2 id=cannon-said-celebs-get-to-choose-costumes-which-often-hint-their-identities><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Cannon Said Celebs Get To Choose Costumes, Which&nbsp;Often Hint Their Identities</span></h2><p>Sometimes, the clues to a mystery are right before our eyes. According to Cannon, celebs' choices for masks and costumes often provide major insight on who they are. For example, Season 1 winner T-Pain chose a monster costume not only because he is misunderstood, but&nbsp; because he is reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a huge gamer,</a> among other reasons. Pretty cool!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=video-packages-with-clues-are-presented-before-each-celeb-performs><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Video Packages With Clues Are Presented Before Each Celeb Performs</span></h2><p>Aside from the costumes and masks themselves, each contestant has a video clip package that offers facts and hints as to who he/she is before every performance. In the case of the llama in the Season 3 premiere, the clues included the fact that the celeb is a "joker" and possibly a radio show host.</p><h2 id=celebs-entourage-amp-agents-also-wear-masks><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Celebs' Entourage & Agents Also Wear Masks</span></h2><p>It's not just participants who don crazy masks and costumes for the show. Their agents and team also have to go incognito, just to add to the suspense. This makes sense, as some of the panelists may have been able to guess who the celebs were based on their entourage, especially if they have strong showbiz connections.</p><h2 id=song-choices-are-bigger-hints-than-audiences-realize><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Song Choices Are Bigger Hints Than Audiences Realize</span></h2><p>“If you pay close attention to the songs that people are singing and then why they chose the costume that they chose, I think that those are some of the biggest clues that sometimes people just overlook," Cannon told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Living</a>.&nbsp;It's hard to not let oneself get completely mesmerized by the costumes, isn't it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=contestants-don-t-know-who-the-other-masked-performers-are><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Contestants Don't Know Who The Other Masked Performers Are</span></h2><p>On 'The Masked Singer,' competitors are also kept in the dark about who their rivals are! This is so great because it offers a chance&nbsp;for more shocking celeb reactions to reveal. Let's hope that Season 3 is filled with&nbsp;more original costumes and song choices so that the intrigue continues!</p><h2 id=la-toya-jackson-feared-her-alien-head-would-come-off><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>La Toya Jackson Feared Her Alien Head Would Come Off</span></h2><p>After La Toya Jackson was revealed as "Alien" in Season 1, she confessed that keeping her wooden mask on was one of the most difficult parts of her appearance. "The alien head was so heavy, and it weighed so much it would tilt me over and I would lose my balance," the former Jackson 5 member told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ETOnline.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id=the-show-was-renewed-for-a-second-season-before-season-1-was-over><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Show Was Renewed For A Second Season Before Season 1 Was Over</span></h2><p>The concept for 'The Masked Singer' may have sounded totally whacky to many, but fans were delighted when the show was picked up for a second season before the 10-episode first season was even over. Reality television clearly finds new ways to turn our worlds upside down nearly every day, doesn't it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Nick Cannon Amassed His Reported $50 Million Net Worth&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=contestants-surrender-their-electronics-before-appearing-on-the-show><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Contestants Surrender Their Electronics Before Appearing On The Show</span></h2><p>Much like entering a top-secret facility (the CIA, any other major government surveillance agency) or even just a high school or college classroom with a strict teacher, 'The Masked Singer''s contestants are forced to turn in their electronic devices before performing on the series, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cheatsheet.com</a>. No funny business here.</p><h2 id=contestants-sign-non-disclosure-agreements-before-performing><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Contestants Sign Non-Disclosure Agreements Before Performing</span></h2><p>It's actually not just electronic devices that contestants have to turn in before appearing on the show. They must also sign non-disclosure agreements before even being able to sit down in their assigned seat. Talk about confidentiality and striving to avoid any spoilers!
