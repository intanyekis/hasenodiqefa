He is a former professional American Football player who played in the position of running back for the Indianapolis Colts and the Arizona Cardinals in the National Football League(NFL).</p><p>A famous running back, how wealthy is Edgerrin James now? According to sources in mid-2016, James has acquired a net worth of over $50 million, which he established his fortune during his career as a professional football player.</p><h3>Edgerrin James Net Worth $50 Million</h3><p>James and his five siblings were raised by his unmarried mother, as his father worked away from home as a harvesting contractor. His parents were not married and James’ father wasn’t a major part in his life. His mother provided for the family working in a local school cafeteria, which barely brought food on the table. Thus, James struggled with poverty during his childhood years, which lured him into the world of petty crime in order to survive.</p><p>He started to play football at an early age, and joined the local Pop Warner football league when he was 10 years old. Meanwhile, during the summers, he worked in a watermelon patch. He attended Immokalee High School in Florida and was later obtained by the University of Miami, joining the college football team, the Miami Hurricanes. James broke numerous records and became the third in all-time college rushing yards, and the only running back in college history to post 1,000-plus rushing yards in two consecutive seasons. He posted 14 100-plus rushing games, being the first Miami player to do so. In 2009 he was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame.</p><p>James entered the 1999 NFL Draft being selected by the Indianapolis Colts as the fourth overall pick in the first round of the draft. The player signed a seven-year $49 million contract with the team, which was an impressive start to his net worth. In his first season he was named the 1999 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press, and won the NFL rushing title. He won the title again in 2000, but the following season brought him a knee injury which significantly affected his statistics. He recovered by the 2003 season and greatly improved his performance, becoming one of the best running backs in the NFL, with over 1,500 rushing yards in his 2004 and 2005 seasons. He subsequently became the team’s all time leading rusher with 9,226 yards.</p><p>As a member of the Colts, James led the team in rushing in six of his seven seasons and made four trips to the NFL Pro Bowl. He was a one-time first-team All-Pro and a two-time second-team All-Pro. He also helped the Colts to win four division titles and post six seasons with 10 or more wins. In 2006 the Colts won the Super Bowl XLI, and the James parted ways with the team. In 2012 he was inducted into the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor. He is also a member of the NFL All-Decade team of the 2000s.</p><p>The player joined the Arizona Cardinals in 2006, signing a four-year $30 million contract with the team, improving his wealth once again. Although he was benched for most of the 2008 season, he helped the Cardinals to win the NFC West title, which was their first division championship in 33 years, and then a berth in Super Bowl XLIII. He left the team in 2009 due to the personal loss of his long-time girlfriend and the mother of his children.</p><p>James then signed a one-year $2 million contract with the Seattle Seahawks in 2009. However, he played in just seven games with the team and received only 46 carries. The Seahawks released him after three months. In 2011 he retired from his football career.</p><p>Aside from football, James appeared in Trick Daddy’s music videos for the songs “Nann”, “Take It To Da House” and “Shut Up”. He was also the cover athlete and spokesman for the football video game ESPN NFL Primetime 2002. These also added to his net worth.</p><p>In his personal life, James had a long-lasting relationship with Andia Wilson, with whom he had four children before 2009, when Wilson died of leukemia. The player now lives in Miami, Florida with his children.</p><p>Besides football, James’ big passion has been car racing. He co-owns a go-kart track in Arizona.<br>The player found the Edgerrin James Foundation, a non-profit organization which runs a camp for underprivileged kids. At the camp, James mentors a large group of children during summers.</p><p>In 2000 James made a $250,000 donation to the University of Miami, as its former athlete.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmicnZ%2BVp7%2BquoyjmKado2K7psCMsKarrJhk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./friends.html>&#171;&nbsp;friends | TheThings</a>
