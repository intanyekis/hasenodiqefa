He has made history by becoming the first of his genre to top the Hot 100 Billboard charts with his hit single, “Ella Baila Sola,” which has broken multiple streaming records. But while his fans are thrilled by his musical achievements, they are also curious about his personal life. Does Peso Pluma have a girlfriend? And if so, who is she? In this article, we will reveal everything we know about Peso Pluma’s dating rumors and potential love interests.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Peso Pluma and Becky G: A Musical Match?</strong></h2><p>One of the first names that comes to mind when talking about Peso Pluma’s possible girlfriend is Becky G, the American singer and actress who collaborated with him on the song “Chanel.” The two stars appeared together on the Coachella stage and later reprised their performance at the 2023 Latin AMAs, where they showed off their undeniable chemistry and passion. Their fans were quick to speculate whether there was something more than friendship between them, especially after they followed each other on Instagram and exchanged some flirty comments. However, neither of them has confirmed or denied any romantic involvement, and it seems like they are just good friends and musical partners.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Peso Pluma and Dania Mendez: Romance, Collab or Both?</strong></h2><p>Another name that has been linked to Peso Pluma recently is Dania Mendez, a TV personality, model and influencer who has over four million followers on TikTok. The rumors started after Peso Pluma posted a video on the popular social media platform, teasing his new single on a beach in the Dominican Republic. In the video, he tagged featured artists Gabito Ballesteros and Junior H, but he also tagged Mendez with a heart emoji in the caption. Mendez posted another video on the same beach, walking out of the water and writing the word “Bye” in the sand, which is assumed to be the title of the upcoming song. She also tagged Peso Pluma with a heart emoji in her caption, sparking more speculation about their relationship.</p><p>Some fans think that Mendez may be Peso Pluma’s love interest in the new music video, while others believe that they are actually dating in real life. Mendez is known for appearing on reality shows like “Acapulco Shore” and “La Casa de Los Famosos,” where she has shown her charisma and beauty. She has also been involved in some controversies, such as her feud with fellow influencer Kimberly Loaiza. However, she has not revealed much about her personal life or previous relationships.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Peso Pluma and Jailyne Ojeda: A Past Affair?</strong></h2><p>According to some reports, Jailyne Ojeda is the former girlfriend of Peso Pluma. She is a volleyball player who became famous as a model on OnlyFans, where she has more than 14 million followers. She was born in Indio, California and also has the Mexican nationality. She is known for her stunning curves and exotic looks, which have earned her many admirers and collaborations with brands like Fashion Nova.</p><p>However, it is not clear when or how Peso Pluma and Ojeda met or dated, or why they broke up. Neither of them has ever confirmed or denied their relationship publicly, and they do not follow each other on social media. It is possible that they were just friends or acquaintances who never got serious.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Peso Pluma is one of the hottest stars in the regional Mexican music scene, but he is also very private about his love life. He has been linked to several beautiful women, such as Becky G, Dania Mendez and Jailyne Ojeda, but he has not confirmed or denied any of them as his girlfriend. He may be single and focused on his career, or he may be keeping his romance under wraps to avoid media attention. Whatever the case may be, we wish him all the best in his personal and professional endeavors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfpbK0u4ypo66lkWK0qr7Ln6minZ6Zeri0zmagrGWknbJuvsSgoKimkaF6rrHXopqapl2owaK%2BjJ2YraGenHw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./college-football-team-rankings-fbs-cfp.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ranking 133 college football teams after Week 9: Its crowded at the top (and in the middle)</a>
