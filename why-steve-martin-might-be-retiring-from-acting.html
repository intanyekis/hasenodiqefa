Emma Stone, for instance, revealed that she had to work hard to <a href=#>keep her cool when she once ran into Martin</a>.</p><p>Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, Sarah Silverman and Mindy Kaling are among celebrities who have openly sung their praises for the veteran entertainer. Martin also notably <a href=#>shares a special relationship</a> with musician <a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a>, who is not only a colleague, but also a friend and mentee.</p><p>Speaking about him one time, Gomez referred to him as “humble and kind.” She also explained that she often tried to be “like a sponge around him,” in order to absorb the wealth of knowledge that he has accumulated in his decades of experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even without the external praise, Martin’s work speaks for itself, with dozens of <a href=#>massive box office hits</a> under his belt.
