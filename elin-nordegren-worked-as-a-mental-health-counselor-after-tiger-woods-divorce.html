She was a model, however, she never really considered herself as one.</p><p>"I did some modeling when I was younger. I was never very successful at it, and I didn't intend to pursue it. It is flattering to be called a model, but I hardly think a few shoots in my teenage years make me a model," she told People in 2010.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Was Erica Herman's Living Arrangement With Tiger Woods Problematic?
