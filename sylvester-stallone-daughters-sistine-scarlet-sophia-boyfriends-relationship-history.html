Now, he's worth $400 million and has had an outstanding career in showbiz. He'll <a href=#>forever be known as Rocky</a> and Rambo, but to his three gorgeous daughters, he's just dad. Stallone welcomed his daughters Sophia, 25, Sistine, 23, and Scarlet, 19, with <a href=#>his third wife, Jennifer Flavin.</a> Now they're <a href=#>all grown up</a>. They're ready to start their careers and, to Stallone's displeasure, date. He might have some choice words about his three little angels dating, but it's inevitable. They're going to find their matches at some point, whether Rambo likes it or not. Here's what we know about the Stallone sisters' love lives and what their famous dad says about them dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-sylvester-stallone-thinks-about-his-daughters-dating>What Sylvester Stallone Thinks About His Daughters Dating</h2><p>After being married twice before, <a href=#>first to Sasha Czack</a>, with whom he had two sons, Sage and Seargeoh, and then to Brigitte Nielsen, Stallone started dating Jennifer Flavin on and off between 1988 and 1994. In 1996, Stallone and Flavin welcomed their <a href=#>first daughter Sophia</a>, and they tied the knot that same year. Two years later, <a href=#>their daughter Sistine</a> was born, and four years after that, they welcomed <a href=#>their youngest daughter Scarlet</a>.</p><p>''Everything in the house is female. The toys, the housekeeper, all the dogs. The one dog I have that's male is neutered. I'm next," Stallone joked to The Sydney Morning Herald in 2010. "But I've never had more fun. I learnt that from my wife. I never did learn it from any other relationship."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's The Real Reason Why Sylvester Stallone Won't Work With Richard Gere</a></span></p><p>In 2015, Stallone made news when he said he "banned" his daughters from dating until they were in their '40s. But that was when they were all in their teens. According to AZ Central, Stallone started to realize that he would have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a hard time with his daughters dating</a> when a boy called Sophia when she was 14 years old.</p><p>''I told my three daughters they weren't allowed to date until their mid-40s but that's not going down well... The first time a boy called Sophia was when she was 14," Stallone explained. "I realized I wasn't going to be an accepting father. He said, 'Where's Sophia?' I said, 'She's in Egypt and she'll be there forever.' Everyone started yelling at me.''</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His daughters didn't listen, of course, and Sophia brought home her 18-year-old boyfriend at the time. ''We shook hands and I said, 'No, you've got to learn to squeeze harder than that pal.' We got into a hand-squeezing battle.''</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Sylvester Stallone's Lesser-Known Brother, And What Does He Do?</a></span></p><p>In 2019, Stallone said he catches himself staring his daughters' boyfriends down. "I thought to throw that in there because you stare at them," he explained. "While it’s not intentional, it’s not intentional but when you have a daughter, it’s a form of temporary insanity when some guy walks in the house. You’re not yourself anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stallone-sometimes-helps-his-daughters-break-up-with-guys>Stallone Sometimes Helps His Daughters Break Up With Guys</h2><p>In Sept. 2020, the Stallone sisters opened up about how their protective father sometimes helps them break up with guys. Sophia and Sistine talked about it on their podcast Unwaxed. They said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he gives the best dating advice</a> too.</p><p>"He actually gives the best dating advice," Sistine told HollywoodLife. "In terms of what to say if we don’t know how to answer a guy’s text. Or if we’re trying to break up with a guy he’ll give us really good advice…on how to cut them off. There are guys that have been broken up with, via my dad, and they have no idea."</p><p>But it's not just Stallone who weighs in on their love lives. Flavin and the youngest Stallone do too. "When you date one of us, you date the entire family," Sistine explained. "So if don’t have all of our approval you just cannot come into the home. But, if you can pass the test of our entire family and get all four yeses across-the-board, then you must be a stand up guy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sophia added that they're not expecting their potential suitors to "jump through hoops," however. "We are not hard on them. It’s not like 'if you don’t do this or that then you won’t pass the test.' We are definitely the most open, fun family, we are very casual," she explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Arnold Schwarzenegger Trick Sylvester Stallone Into Starring In A Bad Movie?</a></span></p><p>As for the sisters' perfect man? "We all require different things," Sistine said. "My little sister wants someone to be extremely funny. My dad want someone to give a firm handshake and my mom wants someone who’s a gentleman." Together they agreed, "This is why we’re single."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the sisters have dated since lockdown, and they talk about their endeavors on their podcast together. "You see on the show that we decided to date around a bit, nothing too close you know, we are social distancing because of quarantine," Sophia said. "We’re out there, we’re fishing in the dating pool. We just keep pulling in flounders and we’re looking for a nice salmon," joked Sistine.</p><p>"I want someone that is a good conversationalist," she added. "Someone that is intellectual and that they can teach me things. And someone that is really funny, because I have a really dry sense of humor and they need to be able to keep up with that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sophia, on the other hand, just wants someone to watch Harry Potter with her. "I want a guy that will watch Harry Potter with me, someone that doesn’t need me to always be cool," she said. "I can turn that on when I need to, but I want someone that likes to have fun and doesn’t take themselves too seriously. I just want somebody nice and down to earth."</p><p>Whoever the Stallone sisters find in the end, we know that they'll find the proper catch and that their father will more than likely approve once he's given the guy a good, firm handshake.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone Posts A Rare Photo Of Him And His Daughter</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqsqSmmsC1sdFmqq2ZnKG8r7GMnZiun5ipsrO%2FjKygrKyZo7Juv8KaqaWdpGLAsLzHophmmp%2Bus7O1xKebrGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6qbXSraarsV8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./mr-smiths-watches-these-are-the-most-expensive-watches-in-brad-pitts-collection.html>&#171;&nbsp;These Are The Most Expensive Watches In Brad Pitt's Collection</a>
