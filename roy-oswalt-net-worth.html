1977, in Weir, Mississippi USA, he is a retired baseball pitcher, who played for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams the Houston Astros (2001-2010), Philadelphia Phillies (2010-2011), Texas Rangers (2012), and Colorado Rockies (2013).</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Roy Oswalt is, as of mid- 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Oswalt’s net worth is as high as $50 million, an amount earned through his successful career as a baseball pitcher.</p><h3>Roy Oswalt Net Worth $50 Million</h3><p>Roy is the youngest child born to Billy Joe and his wife Jean Oswalt. His father was a Vietnam War veteran, and upon return from war found a job in the logging industry. However, it was his mother that passed on to him her love for baseball. Alongside his siblings, young Roy would learn how to play the game, and as a student at the Weir High School, where he played both American Football and baseball. Although he was talented, his small frame pushed scouts away from him. However, after finishing high school, he received a full scholarship to attend Holmes Community College, where he continued with his baseball career.</p><p>However, his small size continued to hinder him, but still he received attention from the Houston Astros scout, James Farrar, and subsequently Roy was picked up by the Astros from the 684th position in the Draft of 1996, but he was also wanted by the Mississippi State Bulldogs, and being a Mississippi native, Roy had a great desire playing for the Bulldogs. Nevertheless, he signed with the Astros, and received a $500,000 signing bonus. He spent five years in the minors, playing for the Gulf Coast Astros, Auburn Doubledays, and Michigan Battle Cats, before he was summoned up for the major league. During his minor league career, Roy suffered a serious shoulder injury and was in constant pain, until one day his truck engine shocked him while he was repairing his vehicle, and suddenly his pain disappeared.</p><p>In his rookie season in the majors, Roy played in 28 games, and completed a record of 14 wins and three loses, with an ERA of 2.73. Roy continued with great form and in the second season posted a result of 19 wins and 9 lost games, with an ERA of 3.01. Unfortunately, his third season wasn’t one of the luckiest, since he was bothered by injuries, but still managed to win 10 games in 21 starts, and lost only five.</p><p>2004 was his breakthrough year, as he had 20 wins, with 10 lost games, but he was the NL wins leader of the season. The following season was even better for Roy, since he was invited to his first All-Star game, and he was the NLCS MVP. Nothing changed for Roy until 2008, as in 2006, and 2007 he recorded his second, and third All-Star game appearances, while in 2006 he was the NL ERA leader with 2.98. However, from 2008, his numbers began to decline and in 2010 he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies, and bounced back with a 7-1 record in 2010. However, the following year was one of his worst seasons, since he had nine wins, but 10 lost games.</p><p>In 2012 he became a free agent, and signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers, and played seven games for the major league team before his contract expired, and he signed another minor league contract, this time with the Colorado Rockies, but had the worst record of his entire career, finishing without a win and six lost games in 15 games that he played.</p><p>Before he retired, Roy signed a one-day contact with the Astros, so he could officially retire as a member of the Houston Astros.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Roy has been married to Nicole since 2000; the couple has two children together.</p><p>Roy is an avid hunter; he won Weir’s buck hunting competition on several occasions, and also owns 1,000-acres of land on which he goes deer hunting – his brother is co-owner of the particular property.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=2.8385826771654><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Roy Oswalt</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>2.3&nbsp;million USD</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 29, 1977</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Weir, Mississippi, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' (1.83 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>86 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball pitcher</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Holmes Community College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Nicole Oswalt</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Arlee Faith Oswalt, Ainslee Grace Oswalt</td></tr><tr readability=0.31818181818182><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/royoswalt44net</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1992893/</a></td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=8.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Inducted into the Holmes Community College Sports Hall of Fame in 2013.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Approves trade from the Houston Astros to the Philadelphia Phillies.
