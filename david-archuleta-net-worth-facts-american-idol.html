And his impressive fortune is the result of his dedication to his work.</p><h2 id=david-archuleta-struggled-with-fame-but-kept-going>David Archuleta Struggled With Fame But Kept Going</h2><p>Archuleta became one of the most popular American Idol contestants with fans cheering him on all the way to the finale. And as happy as he was about being appreciated for his music, Archuleta admitted that he also struggled with the fame that he achieved, especially after the controversy surrounding his father. “I couldn’t control that, and that was something I wasn’t ready for. So, that was very awkward,” Archuleta admitted while speaking with Yahoo! Entertainment. “And yes, I think one of the biggest misconceptions people did have was with my dad. People thought my dad had a lot more control than he actually did. Yeah, I don’t always get along with my parents, and I did have some struggles with my dad, but I feel like a lot of those struggles were created from American Idol.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During this time, he was well aware that this was all part of being in reality television. That said, Archuleta also realized that “it has its own kind of PTSD that comes with it.” The singer also remarked, “You’re basically a character on a TV show, and parts of it are worked so that it fits the TV show — but they’re using your personal life.”</p><p>To complicate things, Archuleta worked with a record label (Jive Records signed him right after competing on American Idol) that “literally wanted me to be a ‘white Chris Brown.’” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">While speaking with Billboard</a>, the singer also recalled, “The label was like, 'Yeah, you sang these nice songs on American Idol, but we want you to be a pop star.’ I never fully processed that. I didn’t know what I wanted to say, because I didn’t have anything to say.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Randy Jackson Has Done Since 'American Idol'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, he launched his self-titled debut album and became known for his song Crush. The album sold over 750,000 copies worldwide while Crush reached the number two spot on the Billboard 200. Just a couple of years later, Archuleta released a second album entitled The Other Side of Down. However, it only managed to sell 67,000 units,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> according to The Hollywood Reporter</a>. As a result, Archuleta was dropped by his label.</p><p>Despite that setback, Archuleta has since moved on, releasing several more albums, including two for the holiday season. The singer even teamed up with former N Sync members Chris Kirkpatrick Lance Bass for his take on the hit holiday track Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays. Archuleta also went on a Christmas tour in 2019 to promote his songs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-also-dabbled-in-television>He Also Dabbled In Television</h2><p>At the same time, Archuleta decided to try his hand at acting by starring in the Philippine mini-series Nandito Ako. On the show, he played Josh Bradley, a Filipino-American singer who makes his way back to the Philippines in search of his mother who was supposedly dead. The show ran for only one season and Archuleta continued to release music while doing his onscreen work.</p><p>From the looks of it, the singer enjoyed his brief acting stint. That said, Archuleta is yet to take on any other television projects. On the other hand, he also became involved in the making of the 2014 documentary Meet the Mormons where he sang a song for the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-most-recent-track-is-guaranteed-to-make-fans-feel-good>His Most Recent Track Is Guaranteed To Make Fans Feel Good</h2><p>Archuleta’s latest song, OK, All Right is a little more upbeat than his other songs and that’s no accident. “I wanted to do something that would be fun,” he explained during an interview with Atwood Magazine. “I can get pretty serious with my songs even if they’re meant to be more positive, so I wanted to light the mood up a bit.” He also further remarked, “OK, All Right is a song where I kinda poke at myself and how much I overthink about things and let them affect my mood.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>9 Singers You Forgot Auditioned For 'American Idol' (And Made It Big)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song is also part of Archuleta’s latest studio album entitled Therapy Sessions. For the singer, the album reflects his own battles anxiety, negativity, and stress. It’s a struggle that he understands all too well and it’s also something he knows his fans can relate to, especially with the recent pandemic that has led some to become isolated from their loved ones. “I’d say I do try to find the positive as best as I can, but sometimes it’s hard to maintain that attitude because negative feelings can really weigh down on you,” Archuleta said. “A lot of the songs on this upcoming album actually are about the battle of dealing with negativity and how to move forward when I’m feeling down on myself.”</p><p>For Archuleta, positivity is the key to everything. It also played a critical role in his career success today. At the moment, it’s still unclear when Archuleta plans to release another track or album. Whenever that will be, fans can expect that this singer will come out with something from the heart. “I’ve realized I still feel more fulfilled when I connect to why I started singing in the first place.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> 'American Idol': Fans Upset Over Chayce Beckham Win</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqivsKhrKWdpJZ6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqetwq2qZpmdmr%2Bqr8CnZKKcn6F8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./russell-brand-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-487685-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Russell Brand Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a>
