According to Variety, each of the leading cast members will be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid a whopping $200,000 per episode</a> of the show. That means that they will all be seeing their net worth rise but about $2 million minus taxes, representation and legal fees, of course. But the leading cast of The Umbrella Academy aren't the only ones who have made some decent dough from the series. After all, there have been a number of actors who have seen their characters killed off after having significant arcs. While they likely won't be appearing in the third season, their bank accounts must be happy for their short roles on the enormously successful show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then there are the newbies. Yes, Umbrella Academy Season Three has a load of new actors set to make a lot of money on the show. These actors are The Sparrows, the alternative universe version of The Umbrella Academy. But who are these actors and just how much money are they worth in comparison to the Hargreeeves children? Here are the net worths of every major Season Three character, new and old...</p><h2 id=britne-oldford-is-worth-1-million><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Britne Oldford Is Worth $1 Million</span></h2><p>According to Idol Net Worth, the Blindspot, and Arrowverse star is worth somewhere around $1 million. She's best-known for playing Peek-a-Boo in The Flash as well as her role on American Horror Story and in the outlandishly successful British teen drama Skins. She will be playing the misanthropic Fei (AKA Number 3) of The Sparrow Academy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-cornwell-is-worth-1---5-million><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Justin Cornwell Is Worth $1 - 5 Million</span></h2><p>Justin Cornwell will be playing Marcus (AKA Number One), the leader of the Sparrows. According to the comics that the series are based, Marcus has the power of super-strength. It makes sense that his net worth isn't exactly set as he has only been in a few things. However, this includes The Training Day series and a couple of success TV movies.</p><h2 id=javon-walton-is-worth-1---5-million><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Javon Walton Is Worth $1 - 5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has just been announced that Euphoria's Javon Walton (Ashtray) will be joining the cast of Umbrella Academy Season Three. Who he will be playing exactly is under wraps. Thanks to Euphoria and Utopia, as well as a his amateur boxing career (despite only being 15), Javon is worth between $1 - 5 Million. Although Idol Net Worth says he's as rich as $12 million... but that's unlikely.</p><h2 id=justin-h-min-is-worth-1---5-million><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Justin H. Min Is Worth $1 - 5 Million</span></h2><p>Thanks to roles in After Yang, New Amsterdam, Pure Genius, and Dating After College, the actor behind Ben Hargreeves has made a decent living. But there's no doubt Umbrella Academy accounts for most of his net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-caste-ntilde-eda-is-worth-1---5-million><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>David Casteñeda Is Worth $1 - 5 Million</span></h2><p>There's a lot of misinformaiton out there about David Casteñeda's net worth. Many soruces claim the Diego actor is only worth $500,000. Then there's Legit.NG's belief that he's worth $800,000. Neither of therse numbers account of his two years on Umbrella Academy as a lead, his raise for the third season, or his work in numerous other shows and movies. So, BuzzLearn's estimated of between $1 - 5 Million makes the most sense.</p><h2 id=ritu-arya-is-worth-2-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ritu Arya Is Worth $2 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to starring in Red Notice, Ritu's net worth skyrocketed to $2 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

That's because she's Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm creator Larry David's daughter. He's worth an incredible $400 million. It's only natural to believe that <a href=#>some of his net worth went to her</a>. But Cazzie has been making money on her own with a few web series, acting roles, and her book, "No One Asked For This". There's no doubt that her role as the quiet Number 6 of The Sparrow Academy will increase her personal net worth exponentially. But for now, Cazzie is worth $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><h2 id=elliot-page-is-worth-12-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Elliot Page Is Worth $12 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's really no surprise that <a href=#>Elliot Page has amazed such an incredible fortune</a>.
