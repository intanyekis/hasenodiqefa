Kendall, on the other hand, is much more in the public eye due to starring in her family hit reality television show Keeping Up with the Kardashians. While Kendall’s family does get along with Devin Booker, does Devin Booker’s family get along with Kendall Jenner?</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner-supports-devin-booker-39-s-career>Kendall Jenner Supports Devin Booker's Career</h2><p>It is no secret basketball runs in Devin Booker's family. Following under his dad, Melvin Booker’s (a former basketball player himself) footsteps), Devin Booker travels a lot to different cities with his team the Phoenix Suns to go face off against other teams within the NBA league. He also went to Tokyo, Japan during the 2021 Summer Olympics to compete with the Team USA basketball team. Kendall, however, does not seem to mind the crazy schedule Devin Booker has since, after all, he is doing what he loves to do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendall has shown lots of love and support to her boyfriend over the past year and a half of their relationship. Back in June 2021, Devin Booker had posted on Instagram a series of photos he captioned, “Be Legendary” including a photo of Kendall Jenner’s back to the camera wearing his jersey, showing his jersey number “1”. As well, during there Lake Trip in August 2021, <a href=#>Kendall was relaxing on a boat wearing Booker’s Olympic Gold Medal</a> he had just recently won against France.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kendall Jenner Rocks Devin Booker’s Olympic Gold Medal While Lake Chillin</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, the first set of NBA All-Star Game fan votes was released. Devin was in fifth place closely behind another player who has yet to play this season. This encouraged Kendall Jenner to tweet about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wanting to see Booker in the 2022 All-Star Game</a>, stating; “you'll know I wanna see #DevinBooker play in the All-Star Game #NBAAllStar”. Kendall's tweet counted as a vote for Devin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering basketball runs in the family with both Devin’s Dad having played professional basketball before retiring in 2008 and now Devin himself, basketball is a big part of the family. Between Kendall’s constant love and support towards Devin and his basketball career to trying to help gain fan support to get him into the All-Star game, this must-have Kendall in his good books. After all, all parents, such as Devin Booker’s ever want is for their son is to be happy and to find success in what he does, as Devin notable has found happiness and success. Most of all, his parents would want him to be with someone who supports the sport he loves to play and not get in the way of it.

Kendall Jenner has also made time to go to <a href=#>Mississippi and meet Devin Booker’s family</a>, including his grandmother.
