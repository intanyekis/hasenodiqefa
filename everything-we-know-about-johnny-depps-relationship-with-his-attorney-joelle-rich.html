But rumors quickly began circulating this his relationship was more than just professional with one of his attorneys, Camille Vasquez. Suddenly <a href=#>TikToks began popping up analyzing their body language </a>and claiming they were a couple.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Matt Smith Before He Became Daemon Targaryen?</a></span></p><p>Various reports shut down the dating rumors – Camille even spoke out herself.</p><p>“ <a href=#>It’s also an unethical charge being made</a> ,” she said in June. “It’s unfortunate and it’s disappointing, but at the same time it kind of comes with the territory. I can’t say I was all that surprised.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Johnny’s alleged relationship with Camille has been debunked, it’s been revealed that he’s dating another one of his lawyers, Joelle Rich. The London-based attorney previously represented the actor in a different case, where they apparently hit it off.</p><p>The couple have been maintaining a low profile, despite all of the attention surrounding Johnny this year. But now that their relationship has been exposed, fans are eager to know the details of their relationship. Though a lot of it is under wraps, here's what we know about Johnny and Joelle’s romance so far.</p><h2 id=johnny-amp-joelle-met-when-she-defended-him-in-the-u-k>Johnny & Joelle Met When She Defended Him in the U.K.</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnny and Joelle have known each other for years. They first connected when she helped defended him during a libel lawsuit he launched against The Sun in the U.K. in 2018. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor sued the publication after they referred to him as a “wife beater” in an article, citing allegations made by his ex-wife Amber Heard.</p><p>The lawsuit didn’t go to trial until 2020, largely due to delays caused by COVID-19. After four months, however, the court found that The Sun was not at fault because <a href=#>Amber’s allegations were found to be “substantially true.”</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Khloe Kardashian Really Feels About Tristan Thompson Rejecting His Son With Maralee Nichols</a></span></p><p>Johnny’s legal team tried to appeal the decision in 2021 but was unsuccessful. Joelle expressed her shock to the media over the court’s decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[Johnny is looking forward to] <a href=#>presenting the complete, irrefutable evidence</a> of the truth in the U.S. libel case against Ms. Heard where she will have to provide full disclosure,” she said, adding she “seriously questioned” the U.K. judge’s decision to not side with the actor.</p><p>Joelle is no stranger to representing celebrities. <a href=#>She previously represented Meghan Markle</a> when the Suits alum sued the publishers of Mail on Sunday in 2021.</p><p>As a graduate of the University of Birmingham, Joelle now specializes in “<a href=#>libel, privacy and copyright disputes,</a>” her company says in her bio. "[Joelle] helps individuals and families in the public eye protect their privacy and reputations,” it continues. "[She] works to defend [clients'] reputations against false and defamatory allegations in print, online and on social media."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johnny-depp-39-s-new-girlfriend-is-technically-married>Johnny Depp's New Girlfriend is Technically Married</h2><p>It’s not only Johnny with the complicated personal life, but also Joelle. Shortly after their romance became publicized, it was revealed the attorney is still legally married. It’s unclear if she’s pursuing divorce, but she and her husband are estranged.</p><p>Both Johnny and Joelle have two children each. While the Alice in Wonderland actor shares two kids – daughter Lily-Rose, 23, and son Jack, 20, with his ex-partner Vanessa Paradis. Joelle reportedly has two kids with her husband. It's unclear if Johnny and Joelle have met each other’s families, so far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-relationship-between-johnny-depp-and-joelle-rich-does-not-seem-to-be-exclusive>The Relationship Between Johnny Depp And Joelle Rich Does Not Seem To Be Exclusive</h2><p>From the outside, it seems that Johnny and Joelle are head-over-heels for each other. But things may not be as they appear. The attorney was there to support him during his defamation trial against Amber Heard in Virginia last summer. Joelle reportedly left her estranged husband and two children in the U.K. for two months to be in the U.S. with Johnny.</p><p>“ <a href=#>There was no professional obligation</a> for her being there. It was personal,” a source said of Joelle’s support during the recent trial.</p><p>At the time, it was reported that Johnny and Joelle would meet up at hotels in secret to keep their relationship hidden from the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while the two are having fun, source say they’re not that serious. Speaking to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, one insider claimed the pair aren’t even “exclusive.” The same source said that Johnny has been getting close to a different woman (whose identity remains a mystery) while he’s in France filming his new movie, Jeanne du Barry.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Leonardo DiCaprio And Gigi Hadid’s Relationship A PR Stunt?</a></span></p><p>Another report claims the <a href=#>mysterious redhead is a French teacher</a> who’s helping Johnny prep for his newest role, though that doesn’t exclude the possibility of a romantic connection.</p><p>Then again, other reports have claimed that things are heating up between Johnny and Joelle. Though they may not have been serious to start, some sources say things have changed. “Their chemistry is off the charts,” one source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. “It’s serious between them. They are the real deal.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It remains to be seen whether Johnny and Joelle’s relationship stands the test of time.
