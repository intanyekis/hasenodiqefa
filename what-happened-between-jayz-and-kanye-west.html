It's tough love, especially for people of a creative caliber like Kanye West and Jay-Z. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The rift inside their relationship</a> is no longer a secret, as they've been at each other's throats in the past few years. To sum it up, here's a timeline of the ups and downs of <strong><a href=#>Jay-Z </a></strong>and Kanye West's conflicted bromance.</p><h2 id=1990s-kanye-produced-several-tracks-for-jay-z-39-s-39-blueprint-39-album><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>1990s: Kanye Produced Several Tracks For Jay-Z's 'Blueprint' Album</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Jay-Z was at the peak of his career, but it also came with a few haters along the way. He was the most dissed artist in the game, beefing against the likes of Nas, Jadakiss, and more. He tapped Kanye West, an aspiring producer from a production collective called 'Hip Hop Since 1978,' to make beats for Jay's magnum opus The Blueprint.</p><h2 id=2002-kanye-signed-with-jay-z-39-s-roc-a-fella-imprint-but-he-was-initially-denied-as-a-rapper><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>2002: Kanye Signed With Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Imprint, But He Was Initially Denied As A Rapper</span></h2><p>Shortly after rising to prominence for producing a Jay-Z album and for several Roc-A-Fella Records acts, Kanye West signed to his pal's label in 2002. He then released his hotly-anticipated debut album, The College Dropout, to massive success in 2004.</p><p>However, the initial rift started during this time. At the time, Jay was initially reluctant to sign West because he did not embody a 'gangsta' image. At the time, it was rare for rappers to achieve mainstream success if they weren't affiliated with such a persona.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2007-kanye-painted-a-39-tough-love-39-story-inside-the-label-in-39-big-brother-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>2007: Kanye Painted A 'Tough Love' Story Inside The Label In 'Big Brother'</span></h2><p>West described the pair's conflicted relationship on the track "Big Brother" from his award-winning Graduation album. Throughout the song, West praises Jay for being his mentor and his hip-hop brother, but subtly bashes him over a misunderstanding over a Coldplay track.</p><p>"I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay / Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay / Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way," he raps. So, what does Jay think about it? He admitted that their relationship is a "tough love," saying that it's a "fair portrayal from a little brother's perspective."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Jay-Z Is Adding To His Massive Net Worth In 2021</a></span></p><h2 id=2009-kanye-interrupted-taylor-swift-39-s-vma-speech-for-beyonc-eacute><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>2009: Kanye Interrupted Taylor Swift's VMA Speech For Beyoncé</span></h2><p>In September 2009, Kanye West stirred massive backlash for his infamous "I'mma let you finish" moment.

Supported by singles like "Ni***s in Paris," "Otis," "Lift Off," and more, the 2011 album went quintuple platinum in November 2020 and marked their first-ever collaborative joint as two rap heavyweights. The Watch the Throne Tour kicked off in Atlanta a few months later and their bond seemed as strong as ever.</p><h2 id=2013-jay-revealed-during-an-interview-that-working-with-west-isn-39-t-always-easy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>2013: Jay Revealed During An Interview That Working With West Isn't Always Easy</span></h2><p>Three years later, Jay-Z sat down with Zane Lowe from the BBC for an interview on Radio 1. According to the Hard Knock Life rapper, West isn't always easy to work with. Those kinds of clashes are common, as these two are the biggest creative minds in hip-hop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He's going to challenge everything because he's really trying to test it and poke holes to make sure that it stands up," the rap mogul said.

"I was hurt about them not coming to the wedding," West told Charlamagne tha God during a segment of The Breakfast Club in 2018, seemingly confirming the tense.
