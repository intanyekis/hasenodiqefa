It's received critical acclaim, seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations, and confirmed renewal for two more seasons. It's unknown if the show will ever be available to stream on <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>. However, it is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">available on SHOWTIME</a> and any other streaming platform that includes a SHOWTIME premium feature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because Yellowjackets tell the stories of characters in their teenage and adult years, the show consists of many young actors that have yet to hit true mainstream fame. Their performances alone make the series above average, and they're not outshone by the more experienced actors. Now that the drama has truly taken off, the stars of the show have likely increased their net worth. With that in mind, take a look at some of the stars' total net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Where Else Have We Seen The Younger Yellowjackets Cast Members?</a></span></p><h2 id=jasmin-savoy-brown-is-worth-2-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jasmin Savoy Brown Is Worth $2 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jasmin Savoy Brown is excellent at playing a determined and extremely competitive teenager named Taissa Turner. The star previously played Allison Adams in the legal drama For the People and Alexis Reeves in Sound of Violence. However, it was in 2022 that Brown hit the jackpot of movie roles, portraying Mindy Meeks-Martin in Scream. She will reprise the role in the upcoming film Scream VI.</p><p>Like Thatcher, Brown has also been a performer almost all her life. She grew up participating in numerous musicals, one of which was what inspired her to pursue acting. She also participated in several different clubs and choirs, and has since continued to sing on occasion. It is unclear if she will lend her vocals to an episode of Yellowjackets, but anything is possible. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her net worth</a> is estimated to be around $2 million.</p><h2 id=sophie-thatcher-is-worth-3-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sophie Thatcher Is Worth $3 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sophie Thatcher portrays the teenaged Natalie "Nat" Scatorccio, the "burnout" who doesn't care what people think about her. Prior to Yellowjackets, Thatcher starred as Becky Monroe on When the Streetlights Go On, and appeared in The Tomorrow Man. She is set to star alongside Chris Messina in the upcoming film The Boogeyman.</p><p>The actress grew up singing and acting, and eventually became inspired to pursue acting after receiving on-camera experience at a performing arts school. However, she continued to embrace her musical roots. Before making it big on television, Thatcher starred in several onstage productions, including The Diary of Anne Frank, Oliver!, and The Secret Garden. Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth is estimated to be around $3 million.</a></p><h2 id=sammi-hanratty-is-worth-3-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sammi Hanratty Is Worth $3 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sammi Hanratty's portrayal of Misty Quigley, the strange, obsessive, and creepy teenager is almost too good. This is likely because of her experience in doing just that. Hanratty played the recurring role of Kassidi Gallagher in the hit show Shameless. Not only was her character odd, but her character was also annoying, and Hanratty's portrayal was genius. However, she's been in several different shows ever since she was a little girl, including That's So Raven and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.</p><p>The actress, who looks vastly different from her character on Yellowjackets, has always shared photos of her in her makeup on Instagram. She's also shown her love for people who've dressed as her character for Halloween. As of this publication, her most recent Instagram photo of her in her costume was to announce that filming for season 2 of Yellowjackets had wrapped.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Her net worth is around $3 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Yellowjackets Star Lost All Of Her Possessions And Her Most Cherished Memories</a></span></p><h2 id=tawny-cypress-is-worth-5-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tawny Cypress Is Worth $5 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tawny-cypress.jpg><p>Tawny Cypress has more than 20 years of experience in television, and has had a habit of playing roles of people in crime, drama, and/or thriller films and shows. Portraying the adult Taissa Turner, Cypress was stellar at keeping up the determined and competitive demeanor that makes her character who she is. Not only that, but producers were good at casting the duo to play their adult and teenaged selves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other than acting, Cypress was able to teach at the William Esper Studio, which she herself attended. She is also close friends with all of her adult co-stars from the show, and recently created an Instagram post promoting her brother Toby Cypress, a critically acclaimed graphic novelist. Her net worth is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated to be around $5 million.</a></p><h2 id=sophie-nelisse-is-worth-5-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sophie Nelisse Is Worth $5 Million</span></h2><p>Sophie Nelisse already had a great resume under her belt before taking the role of Shauna Shipman. The Canadian actress has been in several films and television series as is, most of which are in French. However, film-wise, she is most well known for her portrayal of Liesel Meminger in The Book Thief. As of this publication, there are no other projects she is working on at the moment outside Yellowjackets.

Her portrayal of the adult Natalie "Nat" Scatorccio is interesting as unlike her other characters, she is a recovering alcoholic. However, based on the events in the season finale, her character will likely get more screen time, and become an even bigger storyline for season two.</p><p>Out of all actresses on this list, Lewis is the only star who has been nominated for an Academy Award. After season one had wrapped, she starred in the Hulu series Welcome to Chippendales and had a recurring role in the short-lived series Queer as Folk. However, she has not starred in any films since 2021s Breaking News in Yuba County.

One of her first television roles was of the female sociopath Rose on Two and a Half Men. While she's hardly been the star of her own films, she's appeared in several, her latest being Don't Look Up. After the season finale aired, Lynskey starred in Candy and played a guest role in HBO's The Last of Us.</p><p>The actress is known for portraying complex women in any movie or show she's a part of. The role of the adult Shauna Shipman is perfectly suited to do just that, as the life of her character has been nothing but a complex mess. Based on the season finale, it'll be no surprise if she receives more screen time with all the women, or with Warren Kole, who portrays Shauna's husband.
